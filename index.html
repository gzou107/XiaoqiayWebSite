<p>I am a marketing PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.marshall.usc.edu/faculty/marketing" target="_blank">Department of Marketing</a>,
<a href="http://www.marshall.usc.edu/" target="_blank">Marshall School of Business</a> at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> (USC). </p>

<p>My research interests include crowdfunding, quantitative structural modeling, behavioral economics and empirical industrial organization. In my current research I use structural models to study how effort-based incentives affect crowdfunders’ contribution behavior, how different funding sources interact on crowdfunding platform, the influence of monetary incentives on funding projects performance, and the managerial implications based on individuals’ heterogeneous reactions to effort-based incentives.

        Model of Individual and Organizational Donor’s Voluntary Contribution to Pubic Goods on
        Crowdfunding Platform.”</b></p>
       
        <p>  In this paper, we collect data from a novel journalistic crowdfunding platform that raises money for public goods. On this platform, a project can receive funding from two types of contributors: individuals and organizations (/firms). Hence, a contributor can observe the funding status information from two different sources. Usually, organizations make a large contribution in a single time. This particular funding context leads to some interesting questions: how organizational contribution affects individual contribution? Does it crowd in or crowd out individual contribution? Is it a good idea for this crowdfunding platform to disclose organizational contribution? Drawing on the theory of dynamic provision to public goods, we build a dynamic structural model with individual warm glow effect and solve it using numerical dynamic programming techniques.

        Effort-based Incentives.” (Revise and Resubmit, in revision to be under 2nd round review at
        Marketing Science)</b></p>
       
             <p>  Effort-based incentives, wherein consumers can complete tasks to earn rewards, have now emerged as a popular promotional tool in marketing. In this paper, we propose a model to investigate how effort-based incentives affect individual contribution behavior in the context of journalism crowdfunding. In particular, we develop a unified utility maximization framework to simultaneously model two interdependent consumer decisions in the crowdfunding context with effort-based incentives: contribution decision (i.e. how much to contribute) and incentive participation decision (i.e. how many incentives tasks to participate in). We also incorporate dynamics by modeling consumer reward accumulation and budget evolvement over time. Since incentive participation directly affects budget, the optimal contribution and incentive participation amount involve a complex simultaneity. We adopt a two-step estimation approach to cope with the simultaneity issue, and changes-in-variable method to obtain the likelihood and to address the implicitness issue. We use the Bayesian method to make model inference so that we can conveniently account for the multiple-constraint requirement and unobserved heterogeneity. And our counterfactual analysis leads to important managerial implications on effective use of effort-based incentives.

        Double-Edged Sword.” (Manuscript in preparation to be submitted to Journal of Marketing
        Research)</b></p>
        
            <p>  This paper exams when and how monetary incentives affect crowdfunding performance. Using a simple yet stylized structural model, we identify the channels through which the monetary incentives influence the funding performance. We construct two measures to quantify the crowdfunding performance: number of contributions attracted within a unit time period, and the contribution amount. Drawing on both economic and psychology theories, our study shows that (1) monetary incentives have a market expansion effect by attracting a larger number of contributions in a unit of time period, and (2) monetary incentives can increase contribution amount when the expected reward from the monetary incentives is higher than a certain threshold, but can also have a detrimental impact on contribution when the expected reward is too small. Taken together, these findings suggest that monetary incentives can both favorably and adversely affect the overall contribution amount raised for a crowdfunding project, serving as a double-edged sword.
